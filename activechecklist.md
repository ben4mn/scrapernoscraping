# Active Checklist - Phase 1: Basic Environment Setup

## Step 1.1: Project Initialization

### Node.js Setup
- [x] Check if Node.js LTS version is installed (v20.17.0 ✓)
- [x] If not installed, download and install Node.js LTS from nodejs.org
- [x] Verify installation with `node --version` and `npm --version` (npm v10.8.3 ✓)

### Project Initialization
- [x] Create new directory for the project (already exists ✓)
- [x] Navigate to project directory
- [x] Run `npm init -y` to create package.json
- [x] Update package.json with project details (name, description, author)

### Core Dependencies Installation
- [x] Install Playwright: `npm install playwright`
- [x] Install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
- [x] Install fs utilities (built into Node.js, verify availability)
- [x] Install additional utilities: `npm install dotenv`

### Project Structure Creation
- [x] Create `/src` directory
- [x] Create `/data` directory
- [x] Create `/config` directory
- [x] Create `/logs` directory
- [x] Verify all directories are created successfully

## Step 1.2: Basic Configuration

### Environment Configuration
- [x] Create `.env` file in project root
- [x] Add Facebook credentials placeholders:
  - [x] `FACEBOOK_EMAIL=your_email@example.com`
  - [x] `FACEBOOK_PASSWORD=your_password`
- [x] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` file (create if doesn't exist)

### Configuration Files
- [x] Create `config/config.js` file
- [x] Define MacBook search keywords in config
- [x] Set price ranges for MacBook searches
- [x] Configure search parameters (location, radius, etc.)

### Additional Setup Files
- [x] Create basic `package.json` scripts section
- [x] Create `.gitignore` file with common Node.js exclusions
- [x] Create basic `README.md` with project description

## Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- [x] Node.js and npm are properly installed (Node v20.17.0, npm v10.8.3 ✓)
- [x] Project directory structure is complete
- [x] All core dependencies are installed (Playwright v1.52.0, dotenv ✓)
- [x] Environment file is configured
- [x] Basic configuration files are created
- [x] Project is ready for Phase 2 development

## Notes
- Ensure all file paths use forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility
- Keep credentials secure and never commit `.env` file
- Verify Playwright installation by running `npx playwright --version` (✓ Version 1.52.0)

## ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE!
All Phase 1 tasks have been successfully completed. The project is now ready to move on to Phase 2: Browser Automation & Login.

# Phase 2: Browser Automation & Login

## Step 2.1: Playwright Setup

### Browser Configuration
- [ ] Create `src/browser.js` for browser management
- [ ] Configure Playwright with Chrome browser
- [ ] Set up basic stealth mode to avoid detection
- [ ] Implement browser context management
- [ ] Add browser launch options (headless, user agent, viewport)
- [ ] Create browser instance cleanup functions

### Stealth Configuration
- [ ] Configure user agent strings
- [ ] Set up viewport and screen resolution
- [ ] Disable automation indicators
- [ ] Add random delays between actions
- [ ] Configure request headers

## Step 2.2: Facebook Login

### Authentication Module
- [ ] Create `src/auth.js` for login handling
- [ ] Build simple login flow using credentials from .env
- [ ] Implement Facebook login page navigation
- [ ] Handle username/email input
- [ ] Handle password input
- [ ] Handle login button click
- [ ] Add basic error handling for login failures

### Session Management
- [ ] Implement session persistence (cookies/localStorage)
- [ ] Save browser state after successful login
- [ ] Load existing session on startup
- [ ] Handle session expiration
- [ ] Add session validation checks

### Login Error Handling
- [ ] Detect failed login attempts
- [ ] Handle CAPTCHA challenges (basic detection)
- [ ] Handle two-factor authentication prompts
- [ ] Implement retry logic for login failures
- [ ] Log authentication errors

## Step 2.3: Marketplace Navigation

### Navigation Module
- [ ] Create `src/navigation.js` for marketplace navigation
- [ ] Navigate to Facebook Marketplace
- [ ] Handle marketplace page loading
- [ ] Verify successful marketplace access

### Search Functionality
- [ ] Implement MacBook search functionality
- [ ] Navigate to search interface
- [ ] Input search keywords from config
- [ ] Apply price filters
- [ ] Apply location/radius filters
- [ ] Handle search form submission

### Search Results Handling
- [ ] Handle basic search results page
- [ ] Verify search results loaded
- [ ] Detect "no results" scenarios
- [ ] Handle search result page errors
- [ ] Add basic result count detection

## Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Browser automation is working with stealth mode
- [ ] Facebook login is successful and persistent
- [ ] Can navigate to Facebook Marketplace
- [ ] Can perform MacBook searches with filters
- [ ] Search results page loads successfully
- [ ] Basic error handling is implemented
- [ ] Session management is working

## Phase 2 Files to Create
- [ ] `src/browser.js` - Browser management and configuration
- [ ] `src/auth.js` - Facebook authentication handling
- [ ] `src/navigation.js` - Marketplace navigation and search
- [ ] `config/selectors.js` - CSS selectors for Facebook elements

## Notes for Phase 2
- Test login functionality carefully to avoid account restrictions
- Use realistic delays between actions to mimic human behavior
- Keep browser in non-headless mode during development for debugging
- Save browser state to avoid repeated logins during development
